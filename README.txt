» PYTHON VERSION : 3.6.5

» THE PORT THAT THE SERVER USES IS 8000

» THE SERVER IS COMMAND AND WHITESPACE SENSITIVE.
THE FORMAT OF THE REQUEST SHOULD BE THE FOLLOWING WHERE '_' REPRESENTS WHITESPACE AND THE COMMAND CAN BE EITHER ALL UPPERCASE OR ALL LOWERCASE:
GET COMMANDS : 		GET_KEY		
PUT COMMANDS : 		PUT_KEY_VALUE
DELETE COMMANDS : 	DELETE_KEY
CLEAR COMMANDS : 	CLEAR
QUIT COMMANDS : 		QUIT
NOTICE HOW THERE WERE NO '_' BEFORE ANY OF THE COMMANDS AND LAST PARAMETER.

» FOR OPTIMIZIED CLIENT-SERVER INTERACTION, USE PUTTY AS THE CLIENT AND RUN SERVER.IPYNB IN JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.
USING client.cpython-36.opt-1.pyc OR client.py AS CLIENTS IN THE COMMAND PROMPT CAUSES THE PROBLEM SUCH THAT THE RESPONSE THAT IS PRINTED ON THE CLIENT SIDE IS DELAYED.

e.g. 		
COMMAND	PUT ABC 123
RESPONSE	CONNECTION ESTABLISHED.		RESPONSE UPON ACCEPTING

COMMAND	GET ABC
RESPONSE 	HTTP/1.1 200 OK			RESPONSE UPON PUT	
		
COMMAND	DELETE ABC
RESPONSE	HTTP/1.1 200 OK			RESPONSE UPON GET
RESPONSE	123

COMMAND	QUIT
RESPONSE	HTTP/1.1 200 OK			RESPONSE UPON DELETE
